Welcome to FizBuzz Game!

ðŸš€ Get ready for a fun-filled coding challenge with FizBuzz! ðŸŽ®

Imagine a circle of enthusiastic children, eagerly waiting to play FizBuzz. In this coding extravaganza, each child takes their turn to shout out a number. But here's the twist â€“ if the number is divisible by 3, they joyfully exclaim 'Fizz'. If it's divisible by 5, they shout 'Buzz'. And for those special numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, get ready to hear the magical 'FizzBuzz' chant!

It's a simple yet brain-teasing game that will keep you on your toes. So, dive into the world of numbers, laughter, and coding camaraderie. Let the FizBuzz challenge begin! ðŸŒŸ
